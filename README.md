# FAQ
## Do you have any plans of porting the Grape offdevice version to Pear?
I don't have any plans for that.

I'm not interested on porting the offdevice version of grape that uses the old css of Miiverse offdevice (around 2013-2014).
## Do you have any plans of creating a n3ds version of Pear?
Nope; too hard because it's hard to understand how the 3ds version of Miiverse actually worked.

And it doesn't look right on browser.

## Do you want to make this clone multi-platform???!!!
Absolutely not.
